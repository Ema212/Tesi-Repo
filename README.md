This repository hosts the materials for my master's thesis, which addresses the lack of valid criteria for interpreting effect sizes in clinical psychology.

## Project Overview

The project proposes a novel methodology to define a meaningful effect size. This is achieved by combining a plausible estimate from the literature with a Smallest Effect Size of Interest (SESOI) obtained expert judgment elicitation. 
The resulting effect size provides a clinically-anchored and empirically based justification for sample size planning and power analysis.
