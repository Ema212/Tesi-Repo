# Conclusions

Psychology is facing a theoretical and methodological crisis, as discussed in Chapter 1, which is primary cause for the replicability crisis, undermining the credibility of the discipline. We believe rigorous research practices and transparency are crucial to restore trust in the field. 

This thesis therefore aims strengthen inference by applying the Neyman-Pearson framework as originally intended. To do this, effect size pre-specification is deemed crucial. One way to encourage effect size pre-specification is try to develop meaningful interpretation for effect sizes. In order to do so, we proposed and applied a methodology for integrating plausible effect sizes with the smallest effect size of interest. The plauisible effect size gives the best synthesis literature has achieved about effect sizes on a certain field, and we believe that, especially in clincal psychology, experts are the best source available to interpret meaningful changes, therefore giving some first lines of interpretations for effect sizes. Combining these two pieces of information highly contribute to help pre-speecify effect sizes, therefore encouraging the adoption of rigourous research standars. 

In this concluding section we will synthesize the contributions, acknowledge the limitations, and outline the prospective trajectories of the developed framework.

## General results 

The primary contribution of this thesis lies not in a specific empirical finding, but in the development and illustration of this procedural framework itself. The ultimate aim is to provide a replicable template for enhancing the interpretation and planning of psychological studies.

Specifically, our focus is
twofold: first, addressing the inadequacies in the quality of psychological theories and
second, tackling issues related to the interpretation of effect sizes and the proliferation
of underpowered studies. 

To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive
framework designed to guide researchers in conceptualizing and pre speciing effect sizes

This framework combines informations from both literature and experts...

The challenges we encountered largely reflect the pioneering stage of applying SESOI in a clinical context. With the initial exploration of this methodology along with its obstacles, we hope to offer a preliminary step for future research to develop more refined and effective approaches.

## Limitations

While the proposed framework offers a substantial potential, we also acknowleldge its limitations, requiring further refinement. The methodological challenges we encountered are mostly inherent to novelty of the expert elicitation procedures. Rather than strict limitations, these points may be considered constructive pathways for future development, which we will elaborate upon next.

The limitations can be grouped in two main cathegories:

- **Methodological limitations of the tailored elicitation approach:**  These constraints, primarily concerning the informal nature of our procedure, could be addressed by an established manualized elicitation method or developing a standardized protocol ad hoc.
- **Limitations related to the research context:** these limitations derive from a scarcity of necessary data in the existing literature, which constrained the validity of our results. This highlights the urgent need for new primary research to address these gaps and promote open data sharing.

### Elicitation related

- A key challenge was the inherent circularity in defining the "minimally important change". To anchor this abstract concept, we used a clinical vignette depicting a patient with emerging depressive symptoms, asking experts to envision a slight but meaningful functional improvement. We then asked the experts to quantify that improvement into the expected Kessler-10 score change. While this provided a concrete reference, the procedure remained intrinsically subjective, relying on individual clinicians' interpretations of the central construct, potentially introducing more variability. This underscores the importance of eliciting multiple expert judgments to capture diverse clinical perspectives. By eliciting only point estimates rather than uncertainty intervals, this approach does not capture their confidence levels and may reinforce overconfidence bias. This limitation could be mitigated in future research by employing a formal elicitation protocol, such as the IDEA protocol, which includes dedicated phases for properly introducing and aligning experts' understanding of the target constructs.

- Some experts mistook the SESOI with a measure of treatment efficacy. However, the SESOI defines a clinically meaningful score change on the K-10, regardless of how that improvement is achieved (e.g., treatment, spontaneous remission, or placebo effect). This conceptual confusion was evident when experts inquired about the specific treatment, revealing a focus on the source of improvement rather than the score change that defines it. This underscores a current knowledge gap between methodology and practice. As concepts like SESOI become more integrated into clinical training, this barrier will diminish, facilitating future applications of these techniques.

### Research context related

- The heterogeneity of outcome measures across meta-analyses limited the comparability between the meta-analytic effect size and the elicited SESOI. A synthesis based on a single instrument would have been preferable, but such standardization remains rare in the literature.

- Since the literature on treatment efficacy mostly reports effect sizes between-groups using Cohen's *d*, a directly comparable approach would be to elicit a score change reflecting improvement relative to a control group. We believe, however, that this method may be conceptually problematic for two reasons. Clinicians lack direct experience with control groups, which could undermine the very expertise elicitation seeks to capture. Furthermore, this framing implicitly assumes that the control group cannot show clinically relevant effects, a significant assumption that must be discussed. While this limits direct comparability, and could be further discussed, our chosen approach prioritizes the ecological validity of the clinical judgment we sought to elicit.

## Further/future develompents

Since our primary goal was to introduce a novel framework, we opted for simplicity as the most effective
explanatory approach. However, future work could extend the methodology., building up a more advanced eliditation protocols, data collection or even conduct an appropriate metanlysis for the needed puropose.

Although, as Ioannidis (2005) argued, the ideal “gold standard” in research practices remains unattainable, we aspire for the proposed framework to serve as a modest
example and inspiration for following good research practices. We therefore hope it
could reinforce the importance of emphasizing effect size and statistical power, particularly within the field of psychology, and foster a broader awareness of their significance
in producing more reliable and robust findings.
